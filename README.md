Zühlke WPF UITest Framework
===========================



Overview
--------

The goal of the Zühlke WPF UITest Framework is to support teams (developers and test engineers) doing UI testing of WPF.  
  
Addressed challenges:  
  
How to write clean, understandable UI Tests  
How to write stable UI Test code based on generated UIMaps and wrapped Test-Controls  
How to reduce maintenance efforts  
How to setup a test environment with a lightweight framework  

How to start
------------

The Zühlke WPF UITest Framework consists of a very simple example app to be tested and the according test framework.  
  
The intention of this example is not to be complete, nor ready to use. It should just be a guidance to create a   framework and UI test solution in other WPF projects. Copy it and adapt it to your needs!
